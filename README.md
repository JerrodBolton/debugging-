# Objectives
## Gain experience with debugging
Debugging is a crucial part of programming. How you will debug your code will vary from language to language. In HTML/JavaScript there are a few ways to debug. You can use the developer tools in the browser and you can also set breakpoints in Visual Studio Code.
## Requirements

Insert a logic error into the game you created in the previous assignment. The program should run but give you a result you are not expecting.
Do not add a syntax error (missing { or something that will cause the JavaScript to not run.) 
Take one or more screen prints of your application running with the logic error.
Write a paragraph describing what the error was and what tool you used to diagnose the error.
Make sure to fix the error after you have taken the screenshots!

## Deliverable

A paragraph explaining the error and how you used a debugging tool to diagnose it.
Submit print screen(s) of the error.
